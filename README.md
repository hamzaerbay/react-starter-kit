# React Starter Kit
Easy to use configurable starter kit for small sized projects.

## What's it all about?
Built from scratch and added the base component and lint rules for the beautiful codebase. Using a lightweight CSS framework that [Bulma.io](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma).

Base lint rules added for code quality. StyleLint rules extended [styleLint](https://stylelint.io/) and esLint rules extended [Airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).

Containing my [vsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor settings.
